Scripts for loading and modifying Pocket Queries

BASH shell script for use with Mac and Linux operating systems. Uses standard tools to unzip
and load Pocket Query files to your GPS or SD card. Just modify the directories as necessary
and run ./gcpq.sh

Download your PQ .zip files to the same directory as the script file.

There are four actions that this script can do if requested:

1. Unzip the PQ files to your device.
2. Remove waypoint files (optional), leaving only the cache listings.
3. Remove the original zip files (optional)
4. Change any "found" caches to "unfound" (optional).
